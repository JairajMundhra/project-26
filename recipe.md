## My Own Pasta:
### Mixed Sauce Cheesy Pasta
First take a, pan,
Then pour the red sauce in that pan while heating it up,
Then pour the white sauce,
And add water after that while mixing the sauces.
After some time add the vegetables,
Then add the salt, oregano and chilli flakes,
Then toss the vegetable with the sauce for some time in the pan.
After tossing it for a few minutes add the pasta and some cheese and keep mixing it.
After pouring it in a bowl, cover it up with scraped cheese.
